nosh.py - Eat a little content, using Splunk.

Features
========
    nosh.py uploads a local file to a remote Splunk server and opens a web browser to the Splunk web interface, 
    allowing you to search the contents of your file, report on contents within the file, and more.
    
Installation
============
    1) Open nosh.py in your favorite $EDITOR and set splunkServer, username and password.
    2) Fix nosh.py permissions: chmod +x nosh.py
    3) Copy nosh.py to a directory in your $PATH

Usage
=====
    nosh.py takes one argument: The name of a file to consume.
    
    For example, to consume your /var/log/messages log file with Splunk:
        $ nosh.py /var/log/messages
        
    ..which will return:
        Uploading /var/log/messages...
        Waiting 5 seconds for Splunk to index the file.
        About to open a this URL in a browser: http://splunk.example.com:8000/...?q=search%20source%3D%22messages%22
    
    ..and open a web browser to the Splunk web interface.
