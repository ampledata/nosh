nosh.py - Eat a little data, using Splunk.

Features
========
    nosh.py uploads a local file to a remote Splunk server and opens a web browser to the Splunk web interface, 
    allowing you to search the contents of your file, report on contents within the file, and more.
    
Installation
============
    1. Open nosh.py in your favorite $EDITOR and set splunkServer, username and password.
    2. Fix nosh.py permissions: chmod +x nosh.py
    3. Copy nosh.py to a directory in your $PATH

Usage
=====
    nosh.py takes one argument: The name of a file to consume.
    
    For example, to consume your /var/log/messages log file with Splunk:
        $ nosh.py /var/log/messages
        
    ..which will return:
        Uploading /var/log/messages...
        Waiting 5 seconds for Splunk to index the file.
        About to open a this URL in a browser: http://splunk.example.com:8000/...?q=search%20source%3D%22messages%22
    
    ..and open a web browser to the Splunk web interface.

MacOS X Service
===============
    nosh.py can be configured as a Mac OS X Service. When enabled, you can use Mac OS X contextual menus 
    to select and index files using Splunk.
    
    To create a custom Mac OS X Service for nosh.py:
        1. Open Automator.app
        2. When prompted for a template, select 'Service' (or go to File -> New).
        3. Set 'Service receives selected' to 'files or folders' in 'any application'.
        4. In your Actions Library select 'Run Shell Script'.
        5. In the 'Run Shell Script' action set 'Pass input:' to 'as arguments'.
        6. For the acutal shell script to run, enter: /path/to/nosh.py $*
        7. File -> Save and set 'Save Service as:' to 'Index with Splunk'.
